# Handheld-Game-Console
Simple handheld arduino game console
My name is Kaan ÖZÇALIŞKAN. I am a passionate university student and a dedicated hobbyist in the fields of electronics, robotics, and programming. Currently, I am pursuing my undergraduate studies in Mechatronics Engineering at Erciyes University. Ever since I was introduced to technology, I have been deeply fascinated by how hardware and software can work together to solve real-world problems. In my free time, I enjoy working on hands-on projects involving microcontrollers, embedded systems, and IoT applications. Whether it’s building custom circuits, writing efficient code, or troubleshooting complex systems, I am always eager to learn and push the boundaries of my knowledge. I believe that curiosity, consistency, and creativity are the keys to innovation — and I strive to embody these values in every project I take on.

In this project, I made an arduino nano based handheld game console and tried to port simple version of tetris to it.
